# UOB Student Portfolio Challenge

## Description 
This was the second challenge in the UOB Front-End Devlopment bootcamp and focused around creating a student portfolio. The idea was to showcase the two previously completed applications and to add to the portfolio as i progress through the bootcamp. 

The website is depolyed here https://emkhan89.github.io/portfolio/


## Challenges
I had a great deal of difficulty in solving several problems. Although many were complete, i wasnt able to debug all of them entirely. 

All the background images disappeared when i deployed the website and neither was the page responsive. I was unable to also position elements correctly and have them double up as links. 

I did learn many skills which will be helpful when re-attempting this assignment.
